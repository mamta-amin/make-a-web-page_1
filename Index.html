		<p class="subtitle">World Wide Web</p>
		<p class="notes">World Wide Web is collection of web pages which are made up of text files.  
		These files contain image, text, links to other pages, video, and HTML tags.
		A browser uses these text documents along with other files for styling and scripting to display what we see on the screen.</p>
		<a id="html"></a>
		<p  class="subtitle">HTML Basics</p>
		<p class="notes">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a language used by a browser to display a web page.  
		HTML is made up of series of tags that hold instructions for the computer.  
		Tags are basically commands for the browser. HTML document can only contain text and can be created using editors like Sublime, 
		Notepad++, etc.  
		As you write any code it is important to remember not to repeat code since all that code has to be maintained.  
		Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is one of the fundamental principal of programming. 
		It is also important that when writing HTML code you should use logical approach in structuring your page.
		You can do this by grouping related content within an HTML element.  
		For example, I have broken my page into four groups using &lt;div&gt; element as follows: header, nav, section, and footer.  <br />
		Each web page has a basic structure that consists of some base tags like HTML, head, and body.
		Other sub tags branch out from these base tags forming a tree like structure. 
		Most tags come in pair of an opening and closing tags; however there are some that have no closing tags.
		Below are some examples of tags and their function.  
		For additional tags and their functions <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">click here.</a></p>

		<p  class="subtitle">Cascading Style Sheet</p>
			<p class="notes"><strong>CSS </strong>(Cascading Style Sheet) is a language used to create presentation of a webpages.  
			While HTML allows you to structure your content CSS allows you to keep your content separate from your styling.  
			Style can be included in a web page by linking the CSS file in the HTML document or by writing style in-line with HTML.  
			Last option is not preferred since it may cause a lot of repeated code.
			When you create CSS file, it is easier and cleaner to have same class name for similar elements. 
			This is because when you create your CSS file you only have to write your styles for that one class instead of 
			writing same style multiple times.In my webpage, I have created a class called "notes" that is used several times 
			in my HTML page and have applied same formatting.
